Build Instructions
==================

To build and install the project just type:

$ mvn clean install

JavaFX must be in the path for maven to compiler succeed, but since there
is no public maven repository for JavaFX you need to manually install it,
for example:

$ mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=/path/to/javafx-sdk2.0.2-beta/rt/lib/jfxrt.jar \
  -DgroupId=com.oracle.javafx -DartifactId=javafx -Dversion=2.0 \
  -Dpackaging=jar
